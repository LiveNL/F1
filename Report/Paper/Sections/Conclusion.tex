Our goal of this paper is to predict the outcome of a Formula 1 race on a small part of a track. We want to find unsafe conditions, to improve the safety of the track and make it safer for the driver. However, during the eximination of our results, we figured that the crash of cars occur completely at random. We did not find a significant factor that show how or when a crash will hapen. By improving our model, with futher research, and try to mimic the real world F1 races with extra conditions like driver response or the width of the corner. Nobody can react as fast as a computer and the corners are most of the time smaller than the straight part. So you have to position yourself, react to other drivers, before entering the cornern. Also the acceleration is currently linear, which under normal circumstances is not linear. There are a lot of other factors that we have not take in account.
