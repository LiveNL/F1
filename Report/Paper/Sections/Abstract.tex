Abstract -- Crashes in Formula 1 are influenced by certain properties of circuits. A computer simulation model, based on the Nagel-Schreckenberg traffic model, is used to study the effects of acceleration, turn speed and braking. The goal is to find unsafe conditions of a small part of a circuit. The results shows that the crashes occur completely at random and there is no significant factor that shows how or when a crash will happen.
