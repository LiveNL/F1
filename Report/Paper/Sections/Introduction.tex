In formula 1 crashes are more a rule than an exception. In the grand prix' [LINK] in 2017 only, half of the races had incidents in the section including the first turn. [LINK] We would like to find out if cars are more likely to crash if the circuit has a certain set of characteristics.

In previous research, various properties of racing are already taken into account, such as regulations and safety measurements on technical level of a car to improve the safety of a driver [LINK]. We hope to find particular causes in the properties of a track, to improve which can be used to reach this same goal.

In order to do this a model for the behaviour of drivers/cars is created and used to simulate races on various tracks under a few circumstances.
