- What is the problem addressed? \\
-- \\
- Are there existing solutions? \\
-- There are no existing solutions, however, our model is based on MC traffic simulation. So it is comparable \\
- What has been done before by others? \\ 
-- Others have made MC traffic simulation model, we modified that model, instead of avoiding collision. \\
- What do you hope to achieve? \\
-- Nice graphs/tables that shows perfect clear situations
